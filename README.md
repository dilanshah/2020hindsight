##Problem
Care providers and caretakers need empathy to be effective, and it's difficult to convey a feeling.

##Solution
Simulate poor sight, hearing, and mobility through vr and physical experience using gerontology backed research. 

##Why does this matter

We believe that VR has the power to transcend current forms of expression (e.g. language, nonverbal communication, etc.). 

It is the first person medium that attempts to bridge our subjective experiences.

This in mind, VR can help those who often have hindered communication ability...namely, elderly folk, relate to 
others.
